# Privacy Policy for Muhiyudheen Juma Masjid

**Last updated: June 15, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how the Muhiyudheen Juma Masjid app (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) collects, uses, and stores information.

## 1. Information We Collect

* **Prayer Schedule Data**: Entered by mosque admin and stored in Firebase Firestore. Retrieved by users for notification scheduling.
* **Local Storage**: Weekly prayer entries cached in `SharedPreferences` for offline scheduling.
* **Admin Password**: Stored only in the developer-provided `config.dart`, not transmitted or logged.

We do **not** collect personal user data, analytics, or identifiers.
The optional code for logger using flutter_logs package which is commented out/ not active is ONLY to make it easier to debug when firing notification fails.

## 2. Firebase Usage

We use **Firebase Firestore** solely to store and retrieve prayer schedules. No Firestore usage for analytics or tracking.

## 3. Permissions

* **Exact Alarms**: For time-critical prayer notifications.
* **Ignore Battery Optimizations**: To ensure reliability on OEM devices.
* **Receive Boot Completed**: To restore alarms after reboot.
* **Post Notifications**: To deliver reminders.

Permissions are used only for the described functionality.

## 4. Data Retention

All data remains in Firebase or local device storage. Uninstalling the app or admin deletes local data; admins can remove schedules from Firestore by contacting the developer.

## 5. Security

* **Admin Authentication**: Single static password protects schedule uploads.

## 6. Contact Us
